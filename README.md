# Credit Card Clustering

## Project Objective
This project was created as a research assignment to develop a clustering model on credit card transaction data. The main objective of this project is to cluster credit card users based on their patterns and characteristics. 

## Problem Solved
Discover structures and patterns in the data that were not visible before, and better understand the characteristics of each group of credit card users.

## Background of the Problem
Credit cards are one of the most commonly used payment instruments in non-cash transactions. The increasing number of credit card transactions made every day demands the need for careful analysis to identify patterns and trends that occur. Clustering credit card transaction data can help in understanding consumer behavior, identifying possible fraud patterns, and improving customer service.

## Project Output
The output of this project is a clustering model that can group credit card users into groups based on their characteristics. After analysis, credit card users are grouped into 4 clusters based on what they have in common.

## Methods Used
This project will use a data clustering method that involves the following processes:

1. Data pre-processing: Cleaning data from null values, data duplication and handling outliers.
2. Clustering: Using clustering algorithms such as K-Means to group credit card users based on what they have in common, Elbow and Silhouette metrics are used to evaluate the quality of the clustering.

## Stack Used
In this project, we will use several technologies and tools as follows:
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, stats, yellowbrick, feature_engine, seaborn
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Brief description of the contents and purpose of each file
This project has the following directory and file structure:
- `data/h8dsft_P1G4_dayuima.csv` contains the Credit Card dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks/h8dsft_P1GC4_dayuima.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that contains the complete project code, including data pre-processing, clustering, and group analysis.

## Project Advantages and Disadvantages
The advantages of this project are:

- Using clustering techniques to better understand the customer characteristics of credit card users so as to assist companies in developing appropriate marketing strategies, better promotional offers.

The disadvantages of this project are:

- Clustering results can be affected by the choice of clustering algorithm and parameters used.
